# Windows Edge Light

A lightweight WPF application that adds a customizable glowing edge light effect around your primary monitor on Windows. Perfect for ambient lighting during video calls, streaming, or just adding a professional touch to your workspace.

## Features

- **Primary Monitor Display**: Automatically detects and displays on your primary monitor, even in multi-monitor setups
- **DPI Aware**: Properly handles high-DPI displays (4K monitors with scaling)
- **Click-Through Transparency**: Overlay doesn't interfere with your work - all clicks pass through to applications beneath
- **Customizable Brightness**: Adjust opacity with easy-to-use controls
- **Toggle On/Off**: Quickly enable or disable the edge light effect
- **Always On Top**: Stays visible above all other windows
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+Shift+L` - Toggle light on/off
  - `Ctrl+Shift+Up` - Increase brightness
  - `Ctrl+Shift+Down` - Decrease brightness
- **Gradient Effect**: Beautiful white gradient with subtle blur for a professional look

## Screenshots

The application creates a smooth, glowing border around the edges of your primary monitor:

- Adjustable brightness levels (20% to 100% opacity)
- Soft blur effect for a natural glow
- Minimal UI controls that fade in on hover

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- .NET 10.0 Runtime (Windows Desktop)

### Building from Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WindowsEdgeLight.git
   cd WindowsEdgeLight
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cd WindowsEdgeLight
   dotnet build
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch `WindowsEdgeLight.exe`
2. The edge light will appear around your primary monitor
3. Hover over the top-right corner to reveal controls:
   - 🔅 **Decrease Brightness** - Reduces opacity
   - 🔆 **Increase Brightness** - Increases opacity
   - 💡 **Toggle Light** - Turn the effect on/off
   - ✖ **Exit** - Close the application

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+Shift+L**: Toggle the edge light on/off
- **Ctrl+Shift+Up**: Increase brightness
- **Ctrl+Shift+Down**: Decrease brightness
- **Taskbar**: Right-click the taskbar icon to close the application

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Framework**: .NET 10.0 WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **Language**: C#
- **UI**: XAML with transparent window overlay
- **Monitor Detection**: Windows Forms Screen API for accurate multi-monitor support

### Key Features Implementation

- **Click-Through**: Uses Win32 `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` and `WS_EX_LAYERED` window styles
- **DPI Scaling**: Converts physical pixels to WPF Device Independent Pixels for proper sizing
- **Primary Monitor**: Uses `Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds` with DPI correction
- **Gradient Border**: Custom Rectangle with LinearGradientBrush and BlurEffect

## Multi-Monitor Support

The application specifically targets the **primary monitor** in your display setup:
- Automatically detects primary monitor position and dimensions
- Correctly handles DPI scaling (e.g., 150%, 200% on 4K displays)
- Works with any monitor arrangement (horizontal, vertical, mixed)
- Does not span across multiple monitors
